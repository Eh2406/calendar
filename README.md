# Rust Team Calendars
This repository defines the calendars for the teams of the Rust project. Each team or working group
can define a TOML file listing their events and a iCalendar file will be generated and hosted on
GitHub Pages for contributors and interested parties to add to their calendar application of choice.

## Why this?
Some teams had previously used Google Calendar for their team calendar, but this wasn't ideal as
permissions to update and add to the calendar had to be managed manually by team leads using
a platform that the project otherwise didn't use. In contrast, everyone in the project already
has a GitHub account and we already have processes and tooling in place to manage access to GitHub
repositories.
